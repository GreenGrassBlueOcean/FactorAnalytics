    time series, fundamental and statistical factor models); related risk
    (volatility, VaR and ES) and performance attribution (factor-contributed vs
    idiosyncratic returns); tabular displays of risk and performance reports;
    factor model Monte Carlo, single and multiple imputation methods for simulating returns and backfilling unequal histories.
